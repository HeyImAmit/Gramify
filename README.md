## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to get Gramify running locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (ensure your MongoDB server is running)

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/HeyImAmit/Gramify.git](https://github.com/HeyImAmit/Gramify.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Gramify
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (or in the relevant backend folder if structured separately). Add necessary environment variables like:
    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    # Add any other API keys or configurations
    ```
    *(Note: You might need separate `.env` files for frontend and backend if they are in different directories and have different build processes.)*

5.  **Start the development server(s):**
    *(This might vary based on your project structure. If frontend and backend are separate, you might need to run them in different terminals.)*
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    If you have separate start scripts for frontend and backend (e.g., in a `client` and `server` folder):
    ```bash
    # For backend (from root or server folder)
    cd server && npm install && npm start

    # For frontend (from root or client folder, in a new terminal)
    cd client && npm install && npm start
    ```
    *(Adjust the above commands based on your actual project structure and `package.json` scripts.)*


6.  **Open your browser:**
    Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port your application runs on) to see Gramify in action!
